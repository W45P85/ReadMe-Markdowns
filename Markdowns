# Markdown Syntax
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists 
are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.


# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag


## Emphasis
*This text will be italic*\
_This will also be italic_\

**This text will be bold**\
__This will also be bold__\

*You **can** combine them*


## Unorderred Lists:
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b


## Ordered List
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Blockquotes
As Kanye West said:
> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

\*literal asterisks\*

\ backslash
` backtick
* asterisk
_ underscore
{} curly braces
[] square brackets
() parentheses
# hash mark

# GITHUB FLAVORED MARKDOWN
GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with 
content on GitHub.com.

## USERNAME @MENTIONS
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning 
the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.

## ISSUE REFERENCES
Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.

## Task Lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## FENCED CODE BLOCKS
Markdown coverts text with four leading spaces into a code block; with GFM you can wrap your code with ``` to create a code block without the leading 
spaces. Add an optional language identifier and your code with get syntax highlighting.

```javascript
function test() {
 console.log("look ma`, no spaces");
}
```

## TABLES
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe | :

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2
Content column 1 | Content column 2
